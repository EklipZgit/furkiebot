<b>Temporary rules for maps:</b><br>
<ul>
	<li>
		A map must have basic playability (decent camera, ensure it is SSable, visible color scheme (map contrasts with player and visible dust color), etc)
	</li>
	<li>
		Maps may not be harder than medium Gold Key levels. Hard maps should not exceed 40~ seconds in length.
	</li>
	<li>
		Maps may not contain blind drops where you fall into a place that requires input.<br>
		(As a rule of thumb, if you die more than once there because you weren't prepared, it is not ok).
	</li>
	<li>
		The goal flag should be properly linked to the end enemies.<br>
		The enemies linked to the goal flag should be relatively obvious so that racers do not accidentally end the map early.
	</li>
	<li>
		Maps may not use a zoom level over 1400, due to lag experienced by many players. <br> 
		Whether you lag or not, the camera must be less zoomed out than Abyss. Also, no over-use of props.
	</li>
	<li>
		No slopes that lead directly into spikes.
	</li>
	<li>
		Maps must have reasonable checkpoint intervals. (Checkpoints at least every 15 seconds of gameplay is a good rule of thumb, but can be waived for shorter maps).
	</li>
	<li>
		If a map is character specific, it must include that character's abbreviation (Man, Girl, Kid, Worth) at the start of the map name.<br>
		This <b>includes</b> when you publish it on atlas for the race. 
	</li>
</ul>
<br><br>
MAPS MAY NOT BE DENIED BASED ON "ENJOYABILITY" OF THE MAP OR ANY OTHER SUBJECTIVE FACTORS.<br>
PROVIDED IT MEETS THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS, A MAP IS ALLOWED.<br>
