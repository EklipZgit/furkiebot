			<b>Temporary rules for being a map tester:</b><br><br>
			<b>You MUST place the maps in your custom map folder to test, AND MAKE SURE YOU SEE S COMPLETION AT THE END OF THE MAP.</b><br>
			Steam: &nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp"C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\SteamApps\common\Dustforce\user\levels"<br>
			DRM Free: "C:\Users\USER_NAME\AppData\Roaming\Dustforce\user\levels" for DRM free version.<br>
			<br><br>
			A map must have basic playability (decent camera, ensure it is SSable, visible color scheme, etc).<br>
			Maps may not be harder than Gold Key levels.<br>
			Maps may not contain blind drops where you fall into a place that requires precise input.<br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp(As a rule of thumb, if you die more than once there because you werent prepared, its not ok).<br>
			The goal flag should be properly linked to the end enemies. <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThe enemies linked to the goal flag should be relatively obvious so that racers do not accidentally end the map early.<br>
			Maps may not use a zoom level over 1400, due to lag experienced by many players. <br> 
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspWhether you lag or not, the camera must be less zoomed out than Abyss. Also, no over-use of props.<br>
			No slopes that lead directly into spikes.<br> 
			Maps must have reasonable checkpoint intervals. (Checkpoints at least every 15 seconds of gameplay is a good rule of thumb, but can be waived for shorter maps).<br>
			If a map is character specific, it must include that character's abbreviation (Man, Girl, Kid, Worth) at the start of the map name. <br>
			&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbsp&nbspThis <b>includes</b> when you publish it on atlas for the race. 
			<br><br>
			MAPS MAY NOT BE DENIED BASED ON "ENJOYABILITY" OF THE MAP OR ANY OTHER SUBJECTIVE FACTORS.<br>
			PROVIDED IT MEETS THE ABOVE REQUIREMENTS, THE MAP IS ALLOWED.<br>
			<br>
			For the time being, Testers should notify the Map Maker via <a href="http://client01.chat.mibbit.com/#dustforce@irc2.speedrunslive.com">IRC</a> or steam after testing their map, letting them know it was accepted<br>
			or why it was denied. Testers should then notify channel <a href="http://client01.chat.mibbit.com/#DFcmr@irc2.speedrunslive.com">#DFcmr.</a> that you have tested and confirmed that the map meets the above requirements. <br>
			This will eventually become automated, but for now it must be done manually.
			<br><br>
			If you feel that any requirements are missing from the above rules, let EklipZ know in #DFcmr.<br><br><br>
