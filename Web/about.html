<h2>A Custom Map Race (CMR) is a BLIND SS race of custom maps</h2>
Mapmakers make these maps during the week or so leading up to the race.
<br> Every Saturday the mappers whose maps have been accepted by the maptester(s) upload their maps to Atlas right before the race, and the racers download the maps after clearing their Custom Maps folder to make finding the maps quicker.
<br>The race is held in the #Dustforce IRC channel on the SpeedRunsLive IRC server, which you can access <a href="http://client01.chat.mibbit.com/#dustforce@irc2.speedrunslive.com"> here </a>.
<br>Once the race begins, racers open the custom maps and try to SS them as quickly as possible, <b> no finesse glitch allowed</b>.
<br>Streaming is not required, but is encouraged. 
<br>We often hold large Skype calls that many racers participate in.
<br><h3>So you want to join a race?</h3>
 Join the <a href="http://client01.chat.mibbit.com/#dustforce@irc2.speedrunslive.com">IRC channel</a> and get comfy with it, and be online in that channel at 6:30 PM gmt. <a href="http://www.timebie.com/std/gmt.php?q=18.5">What time is this for me?</a>
<br> You will want to make sure that you select the permanent IRC nickname that you want, and <a href="register.html">register it with NickServ and FurkieBot</a>
<br>You then need to set your In Game Name (the name on the dustforce leaderboards when you play) with FurkieBot by typing ".setign YourLeaderboardName". If you plan to stream, type ".setstream YourStreamURL" so that people can easily find your stream via FurkieBot while you race.
<br><h3>So you want to make maps for the race? </h3>
<b>REMEMBER, AT NO POINT ARE YOU ALLOWED TO LET ANYONE WHO MAY TAKE PART IN THE RACE SEE, OR PLAYTEST, YOUR MAP.</b>
<br>The focus of a CMR is on the "blind" part of the race, quickly learning a map and conquering it. Knowing a map in advance (besides the ones you make) is an unfair advantage. For that reason, we have dedicated testers who sit out for a race to test your map and make sure it is OK for racing, or lacking those, we use a round robin testing system where each racer tests a map. <a href="map.php">Map rules and submissions</a>
