StupidNub: PHP session just allows you to store variables/arrays on server for a set amount of time before session times out, I assume you understand that.  So anyway, all you do is...
StupidNub: 1) Check if entered username and password match a user in your JSON object
StupidNub: 2) if they do... session_start();
StupidNub: 3) $_SESSION['username'] = "JerseyMilker";  (storing their username as session var.
StupidNub: Then every time any of your post-login pages are loaded, you run a session check, which checks if $_SESSION['username'] is set, and if not, kick user back to login.php or whatever.
EklipZwontKbd: k, and what about checking permissions?
EklipZwontKbd: can I make my own global array thing?
EklipZwontKbd: like $_ADMIN['username']
StupidNub: Yeah like you could have a permissions var set
StupidNub: No you don't $_ADMIN lol
EklipZwontKbd: well yeah but I mean, something equivalent except that I define
EklipZwontKbd: or something
StupidNub: $_SESSION['permission'] = 'admin';
EklipZwontKbd: wat
StupidNub: $_SESSION[] is just an array.
