JerseyMilker: PHP session just allows you to store variables/arrays on server for a set amount of time before session times out, I assume you understand that.  So anyway, all you do is...
JerseyMilker: 1) Check if entered username and password match a user in your JSON object
JerseyMilker: 2) if they do... session_start();
JerseyMilker: 3) $_SESSION['username'] = "JerseyMilker";  (storing their username as session var.
JerseyMilker: Then every time any of your post-login pages are loaded, you run a session check, which checks if $_SESSION['username'] is set, and if not, kick user back to login.php or whatever.
EklipZwontKbd: k, and what about checking permissions?
EklipZwontKbd: can I make my own global array thing?
EklipZwontKbd: like $_ADMIN['username']
JerseyMilker: Yeah like you could have a permissions var set
JerseyMilker: No you don't $_ADMIN lol
EklipZwontKbd: well yeah but I mean, something equivalent except that I define
EklipZwontKbd: or something
JerseyMilker: $_SESSION['permission'] = 'admin';
EklipZwontKbd: wat
JerseyMilker: $_SESSION[] is how you access the session scope.
