Mongo setup instructions:

Download windows mongodb x64, unzip
Put in C:\CMR\Mongo  (so C:\CMR\Mongo\bin has all the exes)
Create mongod.cfg in C:\CMR\Mongo
	Inside of mongod.cfg put the lines:

systemLog:
   destination: file
   path: "C:\\CMR\\Mongo\\log\\mongod.log"
   logAppend: true

storage:
   journal:
      enabled: true
   dbPath: "C:\\CMR\\Mongo\\db"




Create the folders "C:\CMR\Mongo\db" and "C:\CMR\Mongo\log"

ONLY DO THIS IF YOU WANT THIS DB TO AUTOSTART WITH WINDOWS
	open a cmd prompt as admin (winkey, search for "Command Prompt", right click and select run as administrator) and run:
	cd C:\CMR\Mongo\bin
	mongod.exe --config C:\CMR\Mongo\mongod.cfg --install
	Open your services manager and find MongoDB and manually start it.
		(IF THE ABOVE DOESNT WORK, RUN THE COMMAND BELOW IN COMMAND PROMPT AS ADMIN)
			sc.exe create MongoDB binPath= "\"C:\CMR\bin\mongod.exe\" --service --config=\"C:\CMR\mongod.cfg\"" DisplayName= "CMR MongoDB" start= "auto"

to run mongodb server but not install it as a service, open command prompt and

cd C:\CMR\Mongo\bin
mongod.exe --config C:\CMR\Mongo\mongod.cfg

(You shouldnt need to do this...) IF VS DOESNT RECOGNIZE THINGS IN THE PROJECT, YOU MAY NEED TO:
	open Tools -> Library Package Manager -> Package Manager Console    in Visual Studio Tools dropdown
		in the console that opens at the bottom, run 
			Install-Package mongocsharpdriver
