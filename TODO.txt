IMMEDIATE
	~Fix map list not getting reset when CMR is updated to new CMR
	~Fix so that tester gets notified when pending maps are overwritten (currently doesnt notify, because sync sees them as the same. Use timestamp)
	Fix bug where maps published to atlas that havent been accepted yet are still registered in the race channel. **Account for maps accepted while race channel is open**
	Fix bug where maps with capitals in their names are not recognized by AtlasChecker ????
	Check for .forceid == true before allowing a published atlas map to overwrite a maps mapid.

FUTURE
	Make .acceptoverride command that admins can perform to force accept a map w/o being tester.
	.startcmr and .cmr dont use correct map count?
	when race is open, .cmr should list race channel.
	DQ's

	Traxbuster stuff. 
		~Auto add maps from atlas.
		Display map download links when .maps is used in racechannel
		maps count should update correctly now? idk?

	Allow mappers to see the maps they've uploaded, and also delete uploaded maps.
	Furkiebot code to properly handle deletes. Idk how.











Randmap race stuff.
etc.
